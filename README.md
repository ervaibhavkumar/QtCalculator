# QtCalculator
This is a basic Qt project having a calculator implemented in QML with business logic in C++.<br/>
Calculator supports 4 basic arithmetic operations. It has a Clear button that will clear the field once pressed.

P.S. Please ignore color schemes. I haven't invested time on it :smiley:.
